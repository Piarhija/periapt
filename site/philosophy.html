<p>Short notes about my current tought proceses and what i want to improve.</p>
<h4>Relationship with tehcnology</h4>
<p>Ever since i was little i was fascinated about technology. I was constantly reading new articles about upcoming devices and services. <br>
I was optimistic about the future. <br> Now as a 23 old girl i percive the world soo mush differently. I think that recent advancments in technology space are missguided and driven only by profit. <br>
They push towards a distopian future where we are not in in controll. <br>
We are constantly incouraged to upgrade our devices to solve menial problems. The marketing logline of new technology is:<br><br>
<b>With ______  you dont have to worry about ______</b><br><br>
On surface that can be precived as a great step to simplifying our dialy life. But IF you thinka bout it its the opposite. <br>
We were conditioned to think that we need to buy somthing to fix a problem we have. We are progressivly becoming more and more relient on technology. <br>
Try living a week without your smartphone. It is hard or near to impossible. The only valid thing i see about smartphones is maps used for navigation. <br> When i travel i really have to rely on my phone for navigation. It is true that i could just ask people where to go or have a map, but damn, google maps are soo much easier. <br> 
You might think that i contradicted myself with previous statment, but i think its the opposite. <br>
Technology can be amazing and werry usefoul, but owerrelience on it is wrong. <br><br>

If we go back to my previous point about upgrading devices. I must admit that was in this mindset till not so long ago. 
I solved my computing problems buy buying new devices, albeti computers, cameras or phones. <br>
Only recently i have realised that i was trapped in this. I was cnstantly updating my programs to the newest version in hope that i will be able to create beter things. 
I was certant that photoshop CC 2022 will allow me to be more creative and free. Oh how was i wrong.
This year i realised this. But it was to late. Now i have a 16mbp as my everyday computer. For what do i use it for?
Web browsing, editing photos, wirting, web building. I could do all of that on my previous laptop. <br>
I would only need to compromise a bit when chosing a program. Photoshop cs6 has all of the features i use anyway.
