<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>Short notes about my current thought processes and what I want to improve.</p>
<h4>Relationship with tehcnology</h4>
<p>Ever since I was little I was fascinated by technology. I was constantly reading new articles about upcoming devices and services. <br>
I was optimistic about the future. <br> Now as a 23 old girl I perceive the world so much differently. I think that recent advancements in technology space are misguided and driven only by profit. <br>
They push towards a dystopian future where we are not in control. <br>
We are constantly encouraged to upgrade our devices to solve menial problems. The marketing logline of new technology is:<br><br>
<b>With ______  you don't have to worry about ______</b><br><br>
On the surface that can be perceived as a great step to simplifying our daily life. But IF you think about it its the opposite. <br>
We were conditioned to think that we need to buy something to fix a problem we have. We are progressively becoming more and more reliant on technology.
