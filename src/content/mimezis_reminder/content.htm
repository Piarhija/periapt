<h1>Mimezis_reminder</h1>
<p>Mimezis_reminder is a self hosted web app built with .php. I wanted to stay organised and have a motivation to complete my tasks. <br> I have always struggled with procrastination and having the motivation to do anything. <br><br> When i was researching a good app to help me to achive that i found nothing good. I just wanted a simple TODO app that has a small reward system. <br> So i decided to do it myself. It was quite a interesting project as i had to learn .php <br> I made a lot of mistakes in .php so our web server was werry unstable in that time. <br><br> At first i was storing tasks with browser local storadge. Then i moved onto .txt files. <br> Eatch itiration of it was getting better and better. For final version i am using a .json file to store tasks. <br><br> Pictures of cats were made with noodle drawing program and exported as gifs. </p>
