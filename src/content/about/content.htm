<h4>Transbian she/her I just wanna be cute</h4>
<p>I write small and cute programs that are easy to understand. Well i want to do that. For the past few years i have been messing around with HTML/CSS/JS and built websites as a freelancer. I still do so, but i want to expand my knowladge and tackle real programing. Currently i have been messing around with .php, .py and .sh.
    <br><br>
But i want to do so much more. I want to be self relient in a CS kinda a way. Having to resize 500 photos? I will just write a small script to do so instead of using lightroom. 
I want to break away from paid software, especially subscription based one. Fuck you Adobe.
<br><br>
With this website i intend to doccument my journey in learning CS, writing about my projects, building a repository of interesting topics, having an outlet to share my toughts and working on myself.
